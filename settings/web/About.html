        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>The Regio Vinco Map Maker was conceived of, designed, and implemented by
            <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard'>Richard McKenna</a>.
            The application was built in order to create playable maps for 
            <a href="regiovinco.herokuapp.com/">Regio Vinco</a> &copy;, a geography game
            for learning about the world. Note this application employs use of the 
            <strong>PropertiesManager</strong>, <strong>jTPS</strong>, and 
            <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries, which were also created 
            by and maintained by Richard McKenna.<br />
